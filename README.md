# Dokkan Unit Creation Tool



This project is in a testing state, so bugs are to be expected. Should you encounter any bugs please create an issue on this repository, or join the **discord**. **(There is a button in the program that will take you there)**.

### How to run the program  
**Python version >=3.7**  

*Run the* **_Required Python Modules_.bat** *file. It will install all of the dependencies required, hopefully I didn't forget one.*  

Run the **run.bat** file. This will make sure the program runs in the current working directory. (**Don't run as administrator**)
